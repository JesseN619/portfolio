                <p>
                    My name is Jesse Nauman. I was born and raised in the suburbs of
                    Pittsburgh, PA. Currently, I live in Chicagoland with my wife and
                    our dog, Phoebe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a bachelor's and a master's degree in exercise science from the University of Pittsburgh.
                    After several years of working in weight management, health
                    screening, and even as a clinician in a doctor's office, I
                    decided that I needed a career change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I began learning the basics of Python, HTML/CSS,
                    and JavaScript. I enjoyed coding, although, intially, I
                    wasn't sure I could really turn it into a career without a
                    CS degree. After a friend completed a bootcamp and got hired, I decided to quit my job and
                    put everything I have into creating a new career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working as a clinician revealed many inefficiencies 
                    and problems with the healthcare industry. My ultimate goal 
                    is to use my past experiences with new tech skills 
                    to work in the healthcare software industry and 
                    improve the quality of work-life for clinicians and the 
                    quality of care for patients.

                <li class="hobby-li">
                    <div class="emoji">&#127918;</div> Play video games. I have a gaming PC that I built,
                    a Playstation 5, and a Nintendo Switch. Right now, I'm
                    obsessed with Call of Duty: Warzone.

                    <div class="emoji">&#127939;</div> Exercise. (Duh, I am an exercise science major
                    after all!) I mostly enjoy running and weight lifting, but
                    you gotta switch it up often to keep things fun.
